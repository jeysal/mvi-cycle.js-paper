*Abstract*

Functional and reactive programming in imperative languages using observable stream libraries
has grown to immense popularity in recent years, especially in web frontend development.
In this paper, we explore how the Model-View-Intent pattern embraces this approach
for modeling discrete-time events in human-computer-interaction and
take a look at how the clean and simple architecture of the Cycle.js framework
enables utilization of the pattern to create web applications fundamentally based on observables.
