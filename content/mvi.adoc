== Introduction to Model-View-Intent

In modern web development, the classic _Model-View-Controller_ pattern does not have
as much significance as it traditionally had in architecture of most applications for decades.
The first major JavaScript framework, _AngularJS_, has a concept of _controllers_, however,
they do not work like traditional controllers as popularized by MVC.
Controversial debates about the architecture of AngularJS applications have taken place,
often suggesting _Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)_ as an appropriate backing concept,
but ultimately, no classification could be applied in general.
AngularJS lead developer Igor Minar has declared it to be _"Model-View-Whatever" (MVW / MV*)_
in an effort to end debates in favor of framework users' freedom to follow any approach
they deem benefical to their application architectures <<MIN12>>.

In our reactive architecture, MVC cannot serve as the underlying pattern either,
because the controller is a proactive component <<Cy-MVI>>.
It manipulates the model and, in many interpretations, the view.
A reactive approach needs to be oriented towards components that observe each other,
establishing a unidirectional data flow contrary to the direction of observation.
In _Model-View-Intent (MVI)_, we incorporate three components along the path of the data,

1. the _intent_,
2. the _model_ and
3. the _view_.

The intent observes the user's mouse clicks and keypresses or other forms of input,
and infers actions to be performed from them in terms of application logic,
thus interpreting the user's _intent_ in giving the input. +
The model holds the application state in its technical representation
that can be processed by a computer.
It observes the intent, adapting to incoming actions by transforming its state. +
The view observes the model, rendering the application state visually
and thus representing computer output in this architecture.

<<mvi-visualization,{figure-caption} {refnum}>> also depicts the user as a fourth component in this model.
The user observes the view and incrementally builds up his mental model whenever the view changes.
MVI attempts to solve the same problem that MVC tried to solve in its 1970s origins,
that is translation between human and computer models, in a way that is simple and feels natural.
When including the user side of the application model, the symmetry of the concept becomes obvious <<STA15>>.
Concerning symmetry about the vertical axis,
the intent transforms user output to computer input,
while the view transforms computer output to user input.

More interestingly, concerning symmetry about the horizontal axis,
the user holds information in his human representation,
while the model holds information in its computer representation.
Interaction between those occurs via the intent and view, respectively.
They act like an event bus, transferring mouse clicks and screen depiction distributed over time <<STA15>>.

Owing to this symmetry, the model can be altered to illustrate human-human-interaction
in the same way it illustrates human-computer-interaction
by replacing both mouse clicks and screen depiction with spoken words <<STA15>>.
In the same way, the model can illustrate computer-computer-interaction between reactive systems
via data packets sent over their event bus.

Another useful property of the MVI architecture is that every component it essentially just
a referentially transparent function over streams <<Cy-MVI>>.
Intent, model and view could - in theory - be consolidated into a single function,
although the split in those three components is indispensably useful for comprehensibility of a program.
At the same time, they can advantageously be split up into an arbitrary amount of functions separated by concerns,
enhancing clarity and facilitating composability of MVI programs.
