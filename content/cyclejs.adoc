== The Cycle.js framework

_Cycle.js_ is a JavaScript framework created by AndrÃ© "Staltz" Medeiros,
who has also been a frequent contributor to the RxJS library <<Rx-Staltz>>.
It does not mandate use of the MVI architecture,
but the concept of MVI has emerged in conjunction with Cycle.js and
is beneficial to most applications that use it,
with those also being the single field where MVI has been applied so far.
The framework and especially its core is lightweight when compared to large frameworks such as Angular and
can be viewed as more of a tool to assist in creation of MVI applications <<STA15>>.

Cycle.js aims to provide "a functional and reactive JavaScript framework for predictable code" <<GH-Cycle>>.
It provides its core `run` function for use with the popular RxJS functional and reactive programming library
as well as _Most.js_ and _xstream_, the latter of which has been developed primarily for Cycle.js.
Utilities for DOM interaction, accessing other external resources such as HTTP requests
and miscellaneous tooling are also available in separate packages.

In the Cycle.js architecture, side effects of any kind are encapsulated in _drivers_ <<Cy-Driver>>.
They listen to _sinks_ from the application code and provide _sources_ of data to the application code.
Usually, data passed through the sources is based on previous sink output.
For the DOM driver, the sink is a stream of DOM elements to render whenever the stream emits,
and the sources are streams of events that subsequently originate from those elements.
For the HTTP driver, the sink is a stream of HTTP requests to perform,
and the sources are streams of the responses these requests induce.
In the MVI data flow, drivers are located before the intent (sources) and after the view (sinks),
interfacing with application code on one side and the external part of the system on the other -
for instance the user in case of the DOM driver or another computer in case of the HTTP driver.

With all side effects extracted to drivers, only one duty remains for the application code to fulfill -
mapping from provided sources to sinks according to the business logic of the desired program.
<<cycle-example,{figure-caption} {counter:refnum}>> shows an example of a simple Cycle.js application
that implements a counter using the DOM driver.

[#cycle-example,source,javascript]
.{figure-caption} {counter:refnum}. A simple counter written using Cycle.js <<Cy-Tri>>
----
function main (sources) { <1>
  const add$ = sources.DOM
    .select('.add') <2>
    .events('click') <3>
    .map(ev => 1); <4>

  const count$ = add$.fold((total, change) => total + change, 0); <5>

  return {
    DOM: count$.map(count => <6>
      div('.counter', [
        'Count: ' + count,
        button('.add', 'Add')
      ])
    )
  };
}

const drivers = {
  DOM: makeDOMDriver('.app') <7>
}

run(main, drivers); <8>
----
<1> The central function that contains all the logic to map sources to sinks
<2> Pick the element(s) of class `add`
<3> Listen to `click` events
<4> Emit a `1` for every click
<5> Sum the emitted numbers, effectively increasing by 1 each time
<6> Create a DOM element from the counter data
<7> Declare the DOM driver and define the `app` element as the insertion point
<8> Run the application with provided drivers

This example also visualizes the natural split of application code written for Cycle.js into

* intent (`add$`),
* model (`count$`) and
* view (return value).

The user's _intent_ when clicking the button is to add `1` to the counter.
The application _model_ increases the stored counter state by the given change value stepwise.
The _view_ displays the dynamic numbers and static interaction options to the user.

The code also shows some inherent benefits of writing isolated, referentially transparent code
that interfaces only with drivers according to the Cycle.js architecture.
The code is automatically reusable as a component in a part of a larger Cycle.js application <<Cy-Comp>>,
because the declared driver can simply be replaced by another driver instance for other use cases.
The code is also easy to test by mocking the drivers,
providing mock sources and performing assertions on emitted sink values.
A recent effort has been made to outsource component execution to web workers running on separate threads,
communicating with the main UI thread using a modified DOM driver <<Cy-SB>>.
This procedure is highly unusual for web frontends and hard to realize with most other framework architectures,
because many architectures demand significantly more boundary points where the DOM is accessed.
Additional tooling, either included in the Cycle.js codebase, or maintained by community members, is available
to simplify common tasks in the Cycle.js ecosystem, including component usage and testing.
