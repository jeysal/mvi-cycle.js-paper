== Motivation

As the evolution of web technologies enables single-page applications to become increasingly sophisticated,
a multitude of open source frameworks emerge in the JavaScript ecosystem - community-driven,
but sometimes also backed by large technology companies.

At the time of writing,
Facebook's React (66,685 Github stars <<GH-React>>),
Google's Angular (24,022 Github stars <<GH-ng>>) and
its predecessor AngularJS (55,744 Github stars <<GH-ngjs>>) as well as
Vue.js (53,434 Github stars <<GH-Vue>>)
are leaders in popularity, while others, often still in early stages,
attempt to introduce distinct new concepts to the market. +
Notable examples of these include
Aurelia (9,507 Github stars <<GH-Aur>>) with its dedication to Web Components,
Svelte (4,751 Github stars <<GH-Sve>>) with its approach using the compilation step to eliminate any runtime remainder of the framework and
Cycle.js (6,491 Github stars <<GH-Cycle>>) with its somewhat radical functional and reactive programming model. +
Some older and well-established ones, such as
Ember.js (17,847 Github stars <<GH-Ember>>) and
Backbone.js (26,307 Github stars <<GH-Bckbn>>),
seem to lose momentum <<GTREND-EmberBckbn>> as their ideas are drifting towards being considered obsolete.

=== The rise of functional programming

While functional programming is not a new paradigm and it has been prominent in academia for decades,
only recently adoption of its principles has found its way into practical applications in the software industry.

WhatsApp Inc. is known to use the functional programming language Erlang for most of its high load message processing <<REE12>>.
The hybrid OOP and functional language Scala has grown to large popularity <<OGR17>>
and has frequently been used for implementing backend systems at Twitter, Inc. <<VEN09>> and Zalando SE <<KOP15>> among others.
Even classic imperative and object-oriented languages have commonly adopted functional programming concepts
into language features and their core libraries, such as industry heavyweight Java adopting lambda expressions
and incorporating the Streams API into the platform <<GOE14>>, as well as the web's core language JavaScript
supporting arrow functions as part of the ECMAScript® 2015 standard <<ECM15>> and earlier introducing typical collection operations
including `map` and `filter` known from functional programming as of ECMAScript® 5.1 <<ECM11>>.

=== Current development of functional reactive programming

Functional reactive programming is a less well-known and much more recent trend, but there are also cases where it has been successfully used
for building large-scale systems, for instance parallel API request processing at Netflix, Inc. <<CHR13>>.

In web frontend development, reactive and mostly functional reactive programming has been getting a lot of attention over the past few years.
In the React ecosystem, Redux (30,955 Github stars <<GH-Redux>>) is an immensely popular choice for application state management
that, while not explicitly being marketed as functional and reactive, clearly takes lots of inspiration from the paradigm.
Its largest competitor, MobX (9,130 Github stars <<GH-MobX>>) claims to
"make state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming" <<GH-MobX>>.

While Redux and other state management libraries are significantly less popular outside of the React ecosystem <<GRE16>>,
the frameworks usually have own distinct equivalents available, namely `@ngrx/store` for Angular and `vuex` for Vue.js.
Angular itself has added the reactive programming library RxJS as one of just two dependencies of the core framework <<GH-ng>>.
Elm is a functional programming language focused on web development with JavaScript as a compilation target
that provides syntax features suitable for reactive code.
Despite remaining a niche phenomenon for now, it has recently seen an increase in interest <<GTREND-Elm>>.

Overall, with functional and reactive concepts sneaking into the world of JavaScript,
we may very soon see not just the establishment of another fraction in the highly diverse and fragmented ecosystem of web applications,
but a general paradigm change taking over the ecosystem from all corners at once.

If functional reactive programming is the future of frontend web development - with Redux and RxJS being just early harbingers -
how will we structure our code in future web applications? What will be the next MV* architecture once we are fully committed to FRP?
